## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely removed once you clone a template, as it primarily manages dependencies for the original template. However, if you plan to update or maintain dependencies in the future, consider keeping it.

```bash
$ bun install
```

## Available Scripts

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
